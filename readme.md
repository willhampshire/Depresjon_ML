# Predicting Depression on MADRS scale based on time series Activity data using LSTM/RNN machine learning

## Introduction
Using the ['Depresjon'](https://datasets.simula.no/depresjon/) open source dataset, ML was used to predict level of 
depression. There are 32 control data files and 23 condition data files, where subjects were measured on the MADRS 
scale.
